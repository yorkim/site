			<h2>What is this?</h2>
			<p>Consider this a brief biography of my professional self aimed at helping you get a better understanding of who I am when I'm working. Whether you're recruiter, co-worker or customer of mine I hope that you with this information can get to know me a little bit better.</p>

		<div class="content" id="who">
			<h2>Who I am</h2>
			<p>I'm 30 years old and live in Malmö, Sweden with my partner Malin and our two rescue dogs Gizmo and Isa. In my spare time I play <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floorball">floorball</a> and video games, do some occasional fantasy/sci-fi reading and go for walks with our four legged companions.</p>

		<div class="content" id="what">
			<h2>What I do</h2>
			<p>I work at the multinational company <a href="https://www.tietoevry.com/">TietoEVRY</a> and currently I'm dividing my time between two different roles. During my entire professional career I've been a software developer but I've recently started transitioning into the role of Scrum Master. The Scrum Master role is probably best described as in <a href="https://www.scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html#team-sm">the official Scrum Guide</a> but in broad terms it means I am responsible for supporting the members of my Scrum Team in their adaptation of Scrum and guiding them within the framework as needed.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="content" id="how">
			<h2>How I work</h2>
			<p>The current worldwide situation being as it is with covid-19 affecting many aspects of our lives means that I'm now working from home full time. While I don't have a fixed schedule of when I start and stop working during the day I tend to start my workday at around 9AM and end it at around 5PM. However, since the Srcum Master role means being there for my team as needed I am committed to be reachable pretty much throughout the entire day and evening. I try to go through my e-mail inbox at least twice a day but for more urgent, in depth or real-time conversations I prefer video chats or phone calls over instant messaging services, text messaging and e-mail.</p>

			<h2>Fun facts</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>I can wrap my hands around my head without a gap.</li>
				<li>I've broken two bones in my left hand at separate occasions. Both whilst playing floorball.</li>
				<li>I played <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bandy">bandy</a> until I was 22 and have a U-17 Swedish Championship silver medal.</li>
